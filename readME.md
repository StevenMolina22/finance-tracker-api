## âœ… TODO

- Implement `GET /goals` endpoint to retrieve all goals for a user.
- Implement `GET /goals/:id` endpoint to retrieve a specific goal.
- Implement `POST /goals` endpoint to create a new goal.

### Roadmap

1. **Define Goal Model:** Create a data model for goals with necessary fields (id, user_id, type, amount, start_date, end_date, status, notes).
2. **Define Goal Progress Model:** Create a data model for goal progress with necessary fields (id, goal_id, date, amount_saved/paid/invested).
3. **Implement Goal CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete operations for goals.
4. **Implement Goal Progress Creation:** Allow users to add progress entries for goals.
5. **Implement Goal Progress Retrieval:** Retrieve progress data for a specific goal.
6. **Test and Refine:** Thoroughly test all endpoints and handle potential errors.

## Reporting & Analytics

### TODO

- Implement `GET /reports/income_vs_expenses` endpoint to generate income vs expense report.
- Implement `GET /reports/category_spending` endpoint to generate category spending report.
- Implement `GET /reports/net_worth` endpoint to generate net worth trend report.
- Implement `GET /reports/goal_progress` endpoint to generate goal progress report.

### Roadmap

1. **Data Aggregation:** Develop functions to calculate totals, averages, and other relevant metrics.
